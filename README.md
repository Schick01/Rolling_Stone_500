## Overview
This project aims to explore and compare two rankings of ‘The 500 Best songs of all time', published in 2004 and 2021. The initial analysis focuses on general aspects of the two charts, such as the most represented decades and the artists with the highest number of appearances. This comparison allows us to observe how musical trends music trends and tastes have changed over time.Next, we try to answer a question that represents the central point of the project: 

‘Is there a correlation between song lyrics and their position in the charts?’.

Through the analysis of song lyrics and their relationship with ranking, we will try to understand if there are any common patterns or characteristics between the lyrics of songs that are at the top of the ranking compared to those positioned lower down.
